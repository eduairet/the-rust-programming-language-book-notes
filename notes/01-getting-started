## Getting Started

### Installing Rust

- First [install rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started), a toolchain manager for Rust
  ```SHELL
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```
  - If everything goes well, you should see a message like this:
    ```SHELL
    Rust is installed now. Great!
    ```
  - Check the installed version with:
    ```SHELL
    rustc --version
    # rustc 1.77.1 (7cf61ebde 2024-03-27)
    ```
- Then you'll need a linker to join the compiled outputs in one file
  - If it's not installed, you can install it with:
    ```SHELL
    xcode-select --install
    ```
- If you need to update just run:
  ```SHELL
  rustup update
  ```
- Uninstall Rust:
  ```SHELL
  rustup self uninstall
  ```
- Check the documentation offline using:
  ```SHELL
  rustup doc
  ```
